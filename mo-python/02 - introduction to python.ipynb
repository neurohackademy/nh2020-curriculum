It's assumed that the reader has at least a little bit of prior programming experience; the emphasis is primarily on (a) demonstrating how basic things are done in Python, and (b) reviewing the many strengths of Python (and okay, also a few weaknesses).\n",

Novice or less experienced programmers may find some of the concepts covered here—particularly the later sections (e.g., object-oriented programming)—difficult. If this is your experience, don't be alarmed! Programming computers is a fundamentally hard thing to do. The fact that this notebook is titled \"a brief introduction\" shouldn't fool you into thinking that one learns to become a proficient programmer in just a few hours of reading and experimentation. Readers will undoubtedly get more or less out of different parts of this tutorial depending on their prior experience; the hope is just that at least *some* part of the tutorial will be helpful to almost anyone looking to learn Python.]"

    "## What is Python?\n",

    "Python is a programming language. Specifically, it's an easy-to-learn, high-level, general-purpose, dynamic programming language. That's quite a mouthful, so let's unpack that...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy to learn\n",
    "Programming is hard, so, in an absolute sense, no programming language is easy to learn unless you already have prior programming experience. But, comparatively speaking, Python's high-level nature (see next section), readable syntax, and use of semantic whitespace make the language easier to pick up than many others. For example, below is a (deliberately uncommented) definition of a simple Python function that converts a string of English words to (crummy) Pig Latin:"

    "Pig Latin aside, the code is fairly easy to read (\"easy\" is relative, of course; I'm not suggesting that a novice programmer with no Python experience should be able to scan the code and immediately understand what's going on at every step!). There are several reasons for this. First, the code is written at a high level of abstraction (more on this below), so that each line of code maps onto a fairly intuitive operation like \"take the first character of this word\", and not onto a less intuitive lower-level operation like \"reserve 1 byte of memory for a character I'm going to hand you in a moment\". Second, the control structures (i.e., for-loops, if-then conditionals, etc.) use words like `in`, `and`, and `not`, rather than mysterious-looking operators. Third, Python's strict control of indentation (more on this later) imposes a level of discipline that keeps code readable while also preventing certain very common kinds of errors. And fourth, the Python community's strong emphasis on adhering to style conventions and writing \"Pythonic\" code means that Python programmers, more so than those working in many other languages, tend to use consistent naming conventions, line lengths, programming idioms, and many other similar features that collectively make it easier to read someone else's code (though admittedly this is more a feature of the community rather than the language itself)."

    "### High-level\n",
    "Python features a high level of abstraction. Many operations that must be invoked explicitly in lower-level languages (e.g., C or C++) are performed implicitly in Python. For example, you almost never have to explicitly allocate memory or collect garbage in Python—it's all done for you. Put simply, Python lets you write code faster than in many other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic\n",
    "Python code is interpreted at run-time: there's no compilation process (well, this isn't entirely true, but close enough), and code is read line-by-line when executed. The upside of this is it eliminates a common choke-point in development (i.e., waiting for code to compile), and facilitates very fast iteration. It also means variables can be dynamically typed (more on that below). The downside is that, as with other dynamic languages, Python is often considerably slower than compiled languages—at least when performing operations that can't be easily optimized and/or bound to pre-existing code written in a compiled language. (You wouldn't, for example, want to write a 3d game engine in Python.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### General-purpose\n",
    "In contrast to many other dynamic programming languages designed to fill specific niches, Python is well suited for a very wide range of applications. It features a comprehensive standard library (i.e., the functionality available out-of-the-box when you install Python) and an enormous ecosystem of third-party packages. It also supports multiple programming paradigms to varying extents (object-oriented, functional, etc.). Consequently, Python is used in many areas of software development (data science, back-end web development, DevOps, scripting engines, etc.)."

It's natural to think, for example, that strings, integers, and booleans are \"primitive\" data types—i.e., that they're built into the core of the language, behave in special ways, and can't be duplicated, or modified. And this is true in many other programming languages. For example, in Java, there are exactly 8 primitive data types. If you get bored of them, you're out of luck. You can't just create new ones—say, a new type of string that behaves just like the primitive strings, but adds some additional stuff you think would be kind of cool to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is different: it doesn't *really* have any primitive data types. Python is a deeply object-oriented programming language, and in Python, *everything is an object*. Strings are objects, integers are objects, booleans are objects. So are collections. So are dictionaries. Everything is an object. We'll explore some of the deeper implications of this later. For now, let's focus on what it means for the way we write Python code. \n",

But in some ways, Python is actually much more of a stickler than most other dynamic languages about the way Python developers write their code.

In Python, the *built-in namespace*—i.e., the set of functions you can invoke when you start running Python—is [very small](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). This is by design: Python expects you to carefully manage the code you use, and it's particularly serious about making sure you maintain orderly namespaces.\n",

Python's import system often annoys beginners, because it forces them to write additional lines of code that other languages dson't.

There *is* technically a difference between types and classes in Python, but it's quite subtle (especially in Python 3), and in day-to-day usage, you can use the terms interchangeably and nobody is going to yell at you.\n",

    "\n",

This is a requirement: all instance methods have to take a reference to the current instance (conventionally named `self`) as their first argument (there are also *class* methods and *static* methods, which behave differently, but we won't cover those in this tutorial). This reference is what will allow us to easily maintain state (i.e., to store information that can vary over time) inside the instance.\n",

    "Now let's walk through each of the defined methods. First, there's `__init__()`. The leading and trailing double underscores indicate that this is a special kind of method called a *magic* method; we'll talk about those a bit more later. For the moment, we just have to know that `__init__()` is a special method that gets called whenever we initialize a new instance of the class. So, when we write a line like `circle = Circle()`, what happens is that the `__init__()` method of `Circle` gets called and executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that, in this case, `__init__()` takes a single argument (other than `self`, that is): a `radius` argument.

Remember, `self` is a reference to the current instance! So the newly-created instance that's returned by `Circle()` will have that `radius` value set in the `.r` attribute.\n",

    "### Magic methods\n",
    "There's a *lot* more we could say about how classes work in Python, and about object-oriented programming in general, but this is just a brief introduction, so we have to be picky. Let's introduce just one other big concept: *magic methods*. Magic methods of objects, as we've seen a couple of times now, start and end with a double underscore: `__init__`, `__getattr__`, `__new__`, and so on. As their names suggest, these methods are magic—at least in the sense that they appear to add some magic to a class's behavior. We've already talked about `__init__`, which is a magic method that gets called any time we create a new instance of a class. But there are many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to understanding how magic methods work is to recognize that they're usually called implicitly when a certain operation is applied to an object—even if it doesn't look like the magic method and the operation being applied have anything to do with each other (that's what makes them magic!). Remember how we said earlier that *everything in Python is an object*? Well now we're going to explore one of the deeper implications of that observation, which is that *all operators in Python are actually just cleverly-disguised method calls*. That means that when we write even an expression as seemingly basic as `4 * 3` in Python, it's actually implicitly converted to a call to a magic method on the first operand (4), with the second operand (3) being passed in as an argument.\n",

When Python evaluates the expression `4 * 3`, it actually calls `__mul__` on the first integer, and hands it the second one as an argument. See, we weren't messing around when we said *everything is an object in Python*. Even something as seemingly basic as the multiplication operator is actually just an alias to a method called on an integer object! Isn't that neat?\n",

Does every valid occurrence of `*` in Python code imply that the object just before the `*` must be an instance of a class that implements the `__mul__` method? The answer is yes! The result of an expression that includes the `*` operator (and for that matter, every other operator in Python, including things like `==` and `&`) is entirely dependent on the receiver object's implementation of `__mul__`.\n",
