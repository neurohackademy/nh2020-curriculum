    "The problem with OLS regression is that it is _overconfident_ in its estimation of the weights $\\beta_{OLS}$. While attempting to minimize loss, OLS will allow the weights to take on any values, even extreme and bizarre values that are incredibly unlikely to accurately reflect reality. Ridge regression solves this problem by forcing the values in $\\beta$ to be small (i.e. close to zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is roughly equivalent to assuming that the noise term, $\\epsilon(t)$, is large (or, at least, larger than it would have otherwise been). You can see this by thinking about the equation for the noise term: $\\epsilon(t) = y(t) - x(t) \\beta$. We know that $\\epsilon(t)$ really shouldn't be any bigger than $y(t)$--worst case we can set $\\beta=0$ and then we get an exact equivalence. If weights $\\beta_{OLS}$ exactly minimize the size of the noise term, then making the weights smaller will necessarily make the noise term bigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ridge regression\n",
    "The simplest way to describe ridge regression mathematically is including a **penalty** on the size of the weights in the loss function. Specifically, ridge regression penalizes the sum of the squared weights, leading to a new and improved loss function that we'll call $\\mathcal{L}_{ridge}(\\beta)$:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The first term on the right hand side of this equation is the same squared error loss that we used before for OLS. The second term is the sum of the squares of all the weights in $\\beta$, multiplied by a scalar variable $\\lambda$ that we will call the **ridge coefficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ridge coefficient $\\lambda$ determines the _strength_ of the regularization that's applied in ridge regression: \n",
    "* If you give $\\lambda$ a large value, then the penalty term will be big relative to the loss, and the resulting weights will be very small. (In the limit of very large $\\lambda$ you will force the weights to be almost exactly zero!) \n",
    "* If you give $\\lambda$ a small value, then the penalty term will be small relative to the loss, and the resulting weights will not be too different from the OLS weights. (In the limit of $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$, the penalty term will be zero and you'll get back exactly the OLS solution!)\n",

    "To get the ridge regression weights, $\\beta_{ridge}$, you minimize the ridge loss function. We don't need to go through the full derivation of the solution (though it's pretty fun, and easy to do based on the matrix calculus we did for the OLS solution!), so let's just take a look at the answer:\n",

I want to note that this second interpretation is _exactly mathematically equivalent_ to what you've already seen, it's just a different way of thinking about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember Bayes' rule? $P(a|b) = \\frac{P(b|a) P(a)}{P(b)}$, right? It turns out we can use Bayes' rule to derive ridge regression if we plug in the right variables in the right places. To do this we kind of have to go back to the beginning, but I think it's a much quicker trip once you've already gotten to this point once.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a Bayesian viewpoint, the goal of regression is to find the most probably set of weights ($\\beta$) given the observed data ($x(t), y(t)$). Mathematically, that means we're trying to find the set of weights $\\beta$ that maximize $P(\\beta | x(t), y(t))$ (read as \"probability of $\\beta$ given $x(t)$ and $y(t)$\").\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't really know what $P(\\beta | x(t),y(t))$ is—that's not how we defined our regression model—but we DO know what $P(y(t) | x(t), \\beta)$ is! The assumptions that we've been working with so far (squared error loss, etc.), imply that $P(y(t) | x(t), \\beta)$ is actually a Gaussian distribution (aka Normal distribution). The mean of this distribution is (we assume) $x(t) \\beta$, and it has some variance that we don't know ahead of time (this is the size of the noise term $\\epsilon(t)$). We can write that like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(y(t) | x(t), \\beta) = \\mathcal{N}(x(t) \\beta, \\sigma^2), $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $\\mathcal{N}(x(t) \\beta, \\sigma^2)$ denotes a Normal distribution with mean $x(t) \\beta$ and variance $\\sigma^2$.\n",
    "* $\\sigma^2$ is the size of the noise. We don't know what this is yet!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok now we kind of know what $P(y(t) | x(t), \\beta)$ is, and we know Bayes' rule. We can combine these things to figure out $P(\\beta | y(t), x(t))$, which is the thing we actually want to maximize! Let's see how that goes..\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\beta | y(t), x(t)) = \\frac{P(y(t) | x(t), \\beta) P(\\beta)}{P(y(t))} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Huh ok. Bayes' rule says that in order to get the thing we want ($P(\\beta | y(t), x(t))$), we take the thing we know ($P(y(t) | x(t), \\beta)$), multiply it by some weird new thing ($P(\\beta)$), and then divide it by some other weird new thing ($P(y(t)$). Let's step through these different terms, what they mean, and how we can handle them:\n",
    "* $P(y(t) | x(t), \\beta)$. This is the thing we already know. It's sometimes called the \"likelihood\" function. We're modeling it as a Gaussian distribution. All good!\n",
    "* $P(\\beta)$. This is a new one. It's called the \"prior\" distribution on $\\beta$. Think of it as \"given absolutely no information about any of the data, what values of $\\beta$ do we think are more or less likely?\" (Foreshadowing: _this is where the magic will happen._)\n",
    "* $P(y(t))$. This is also a new one. Fortunately, we can ignore it entirely! It doesn't matter one bit what the value of this function is, because it's independent of $\\beta$, so our choice of the best $\\beta$ is unaffected by it! Whew.\n",
    "\n",
    "So clearly the most important new thing here is the prior, $P(\\beta)$. **Let's suppose that $P(\\beta)$ is another Gaussian distribution.** That is, let's say that $P(\\beta) = \\mathcal{N}(0, \\lambda^{-1} I)$, a multivariate Gaussian distribution (because $\\beta$ typically is a vector containing more than one value) with mean zero and covariance $\\lambda^{-1} I$. You may have an inkling of where this is heading now..\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "P(\\beta | y(t), x(t)) & = & \\frac{P(y(t) | x(t), \\beta) P(\\beta)}{P(y(t))} \\\\\n",

It should, because it's pretty much the same as the ridge loss function (or, at least, the negative of the ridge loss function)! Recall that our goal here is to maximize the probability of $\\beta$ given $y(t)$ and $x(t)$. This equation shows us that maximizing that probability is _exactly equivalent_ to minimizing the ridge loss function.
