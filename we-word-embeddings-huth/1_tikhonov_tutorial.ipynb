    "# Part 1: Regression: what is it? Why would you use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm interested in \"predictive\" models of brain responses. Suppose you do an experiment where you're recording some kind of brain responses, let's call them $y(t)$, while you provide your experimental subject with some kind of stimulus, let's call that $s(t)$. I think you can claim to understand something about what the brain is doing if you can build a model that predicts $y(t)$ from $s(t)$. (I think this claim is especially true if $s(t)$ is a \"natural\" stimulus, i.e. something that you would expect to see in everyday life, rather than something concocted specifically in a laboratory.)\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we build a model that predicts $y(t)$ from $s(t)$? There are lots of approaches! But they all use one core concept: **_regression_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do regression like this:\n",
    "### 1. Extract features ###\n",
    "You say \"I can break $s(t)$ into different parts, or features\". This transforms $s(t)$ into some other representation that we'll call $x(t)$. Let's say that the number of features in $x(t)$ is $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Define the model ###\n",
    "You say \"I can predict $y(t)$ from a weighted combination of the features in $x(t)$\". This means you are imagining a model that looks something like this,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^p x_i(t) \\beta_i + \\epsilon(t),$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $x_i(t)$ refers to the $i$th feature in $x(t)$, \n",
    "* $\\beta_i$ refers to the weight on that feature (we don't know what this weight is yet), and \n",
    "* $\\epsilon(t)$ refers to the noise, i.e. any part of $y(t)$ that you can't predict from $x(t)$ (we don't know what this is yet either).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this model is just a weighted sum, we can write it more simply using a little linear algebra,\n",
    "$$y(t) = x(t) \\beta + \\epsilon(t),$$\n",
    "where $x(t)$ is now a $1 \\times p$ vector of feature values and $\\beta$ is a $p \\times 1$ vector of weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with these equations more easily, we'll need to stack the values of $y(t)$ and $x(t)$ into matrices. Let's define those matrices like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y = \\begin{bmatrix} y(t=1) \\\\ y(t=2) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y(t=T) \\end{bmatrix}, \\;\n",

    "### 3. Estimate the model weights, $\\beta$ ###\n",
    "You say \"I need to find the weights $\\beta$ that make my model good at predicting $y(t)$\". Here's where the magic is! To do this we're first going to define a **_loss function_** $\\mathcal{L}(\\beta)$, which tells us how good our model is for any particular value of the weight vector $\\beta$. (It's called a loss function because bigger values == bigger loss == a worse model. So we want the loss function to be as small as possible.)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's start by converting the sum in $\\mathcal{L}(\\beta)$ into a matrix multiplication. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common loss function (and best, in most situations) is **squared error loss**, which looks like this:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\beta) = \\sum_{t=1}^T (y(t) - x(t) \\beta)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or, in matrix terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\beta) = (Y - X\\beta)^\\top (Y - X \\beta) $$\n",
    "(If it's not clear why this is equivalent to our first expression for the loss function, try to re-imagine this equation as a summation across timepoints.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this function you can now try to find the best values for $\\beta$! Our goal here is to find the value of $\\beta$ that minimizes the loss function. Think back to when you first learned calculus.. do you remember learning how to find the minimum of a function? In particular, our loss function is actually a parabola (why?), which means it has (approximately) one minimum! We can find this minimum by taking the derivative of the loss function with respect to $\\beta$, and then finding the value of $\\beta$ that sets the derivative to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can expand the multiplication in our loss function:\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\beta) = Y^\\top Y - 2 Y^\\top X \\beta + \\beta^\\top X^\\top X \\beta $$\n",
    "Taking the derivative then gives us this expression:\n",
    "$$\\frac{d \\mathcal{L}(\\beta)}{d \\beta} = -2 Y^\\top X + 2 \\beta^\\top X^\\top X $$\n",
    "Here, the $Y^\\top Y$ term disappeared because it didn't depend on $\\beta$. If you want to know how the other terms came about, you might want to peruse the [somewhat baroque rules of matrix calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_calculus).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to find the best value of $\\beta$ we need to set $\\frac{d \\mathcal{L}(\\beta)}{d \\beta} = 0$ and then solve for $\\beta$:\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\\frac{d \\mathcal{L}(\\beta)}{d \\beta} &=& 0 \\\\\n",
    "-2 Y^\\top X + 2 \\beta^\\top X^\\top X &=& 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\beta^\\top X^\\top X &=& Y^\\top X \\\\\n",
    "X^\\top X \\beta &=& X^\\top Y \\mbox{  (transposed both sides)} \\\\\n",
    "\\beta &=& (X^\\top X)^{-1} X^\\top Y\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And there we have it! The best possible weights for predicting $y(t)$ from $x(t)$ are given by this neat little expression: $\\beta = (X^\\top X)^{-1} X^\\top Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, we're going to refer to this regression procedure as **_ordinary least squares_** or **_OLS_**, and the solution that we derived as \"the OLS solution\" or $\\beta_{OLS}$.\n",
