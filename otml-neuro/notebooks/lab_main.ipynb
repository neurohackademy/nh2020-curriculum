    "Note that $a$ and $b$ are not required to have the same dimension.\n",
    "The cost matrix $C \\in \\mathbb{R}_+^{n \\times m}$ contains the pairwise costs $C_{ij}$ of transporting a unit of mass from bin $i$ in $a$ to bin $j$ in $b$.\n",
    "Then the OT problem reads\n",

    "L_C(a,b) = \\min_{P \\in U(a,b)} \\langle C, P \\rangle,\n",

    "where the feasible set $U(a,b)$ consists of all matrices in $\\mathbb{R}_+^{n \\times m}$ whose rows sum to $a$ and columns sum to $b$ (that is, all valid transportation plans between discrete measures).\n",

    "As the name suggests, entropy-regularized optimal transport proposes to augment the original OT optimization problem with a regularization term given by the entropy of the transport plan.\n",

    "- The entropy-regularized problem is strongly convex in $P$; it therefore admits a unique solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "A key perspective in OT is that it is not only a method to compute minimial-cost transport plans between probabilities, but also it provides a mathematically well-defined notion of __distance__ between probabilities whenever we can specify a unit cost of transport between two points in the space on which they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "This perspective motivates the concept of a *Wasserstein barycenter*, which solves\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min_{b \\in \\Sigma_m} \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^S L_C(a_s, b),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\{a_s\\}_{s=1}^S$ are a collection of histograms. A Wasserstein barycenter can thus be viewed as an average between observed histograms, where the average is taken over the optimal transport costs between each observation and the barycenter.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Exercise:__ Show that the arithmetic mean of observations $\\{a_s\\}_{s=1}^S$ corresponds to the Wasserstein barycenter when $L_C(a_s, b) = \\lVert a_s-b \\rVert_2^2$.\n",

    "\n",
    "A key advantage of this formulation is that it can be re-written as an optimization problem over $S$ transportation plans $P_s$, $s = 1, ..., S$, such that each $P_s$ has observation $a_s$ as its row sum and all transportation plans share the barycenter $b$ as their column sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} (P_1)_{ij} = ... = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_S} (P_S)_{ij} = b_j, \\ \\ \\text{ for every } j=1, ..., m,$$\n",

    "$$ b = P_1^\\top 1 = P_2^\\top 1 = \\ \\ ... \\ \\ = P_S^\\top 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem in turn can be solved by an extension of the same Sinkhorn algorithm used in the previous section, where now have $S$ cost matrices $C_s$ and are required to find $S$ sets of scaling vectors $(u_s, v_s)$.\n",

    "### 3.3 Optimal transport regularization for MEG source imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.1 Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we discuss the application of these OT tools to a problem of scientific interest: group-level source imaging with MEG data. Source imaging is an inverse problem in which a lower-dimensional observed signal is mapped to a high-dimensional but unobserved source space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a group study, signals are recorded from multiple individuals under the same experimental condition, and the objective is to infer a source signal for each individual. This is known as the \"multi-task\" setting in machine learning. The multi-task problem can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min_{x_1, ..., x_S \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\frac{1}{2n} \\sum_{s=1}^S || y_s - L_s x_s ||_2^2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_s \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the observed signal, $L_s \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times p}$ is the known linear transformation from source to sensor space, and $s \\in \\{1, ..., S\\}$ indexes the individuals in the group study. The goal is to find the source signals $x_1, ..., x_S$ that minimize the reconstruction error of the observed signal in sensor space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.2 Regularization via the Wasserstein barycenter\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, inverse problems of the kind described above are \"ill-posed\" in the sense that they do not admit a unique solution; there are many possible source signals that may have given rise to the observed sensor measurements. The problem must therefore be constrained by some additional component that helps us select between possible explanations for the data - in optimization, this is known as _regularization_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, OT has been applied to the group-level source imaging problem as a means to define a regularization term, which yields the _multi-task Wasserstein_ (MTW) model [[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.07833.pdf). The idea is to add a term of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min_{b \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^S L^\\varepsilon_C(b, x_s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "to the multi-task problem. The result is that the estimated signals $x_1, ..., x_S$ are encouraged to be \"close\" to each other in the sense of minimizing distance to the (equal-weight) Wasserstein barycenter. This reflects the expectation that there will be some similarity across individuals in the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full MTW problem is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min_{x_1, ..., x_S \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\overbrace{\\frac{1}{2n} \\sum_{s=1}^S || y_s - L_s x_s ||_2^2}^{\\text{fit to observed signal}} + \\overbrace{\\alpha \\min_{b \\in \\mathbb{R}^p} \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=1}^S L^\\varepsilon_C(b, x_s)}^{\\text{distance to source barycenter}} + \\underbrace{\\beta ||x_s||_1}_{\\text{sparsity}},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the additional $||x_s||_1$ term enforces sparsity in the estimated signal. The parameters of the model are thus $\\varepsilon$ (entropy smoothing), $\\alpha$ (strength of Wasserstein penalty), and $\\beta$ (strength of sparsity penalty).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.3 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We include a small example using MEG recordings from two individuals. The data are obtained from [[4]](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.889235); they have already been preprocessed, so that for each individual we have the corresponding gain matrix and sensor measurements."
