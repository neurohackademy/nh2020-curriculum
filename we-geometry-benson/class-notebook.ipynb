In the lecture and the Neurohackademy Jupyterhub environment, we will look primarily at a subject named `nben`; however, you can alternately use the subject `bert`, which is an example subject that comes with FreeSurfer. Optionally, this notebook can be used with subject from the [Human Connectome Project (HCP)](https://db.humanconnectome.org/)--see the `README.md` file for instructions on getting credentials for use with the HCP.\n",

At its core, `neuropythy` is a library for interacting with neuroscientific data in the context of brain structure.\n",

Alignments are calculated by warping the vertices of the subject's spherical (fully inflated) hemisphere in a diffeomorphic fashion with the goal of minimizing the difference between the sulcal topology (curvature and depth) of the subject's vertices and that of the nearby *fsaverage* vertices.
