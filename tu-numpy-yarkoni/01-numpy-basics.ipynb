    "# Numpy Basics\n",

    "[Presented at [Neurohackademy 2020](https://neurohackademy.org) by [Tal Yarkoni](https://talyarkoni.org)]\n",

    "In this tutorial, we'll introduce numpy—Python's workhorse numerical computing library. We'll begin by motivating the need for a package like numpy, especially in domains with large datasets, like neuroimaging. Then we'll walk through some numpy basics. We'll introduce the core N-Dimensional Array structure; explore ways to initialize, inspect, and index arrays; and review some basic ways to manipulate them, including restructuring operations and application of basic mathematical and statistical functions. At the end of this tutorial, you should have a general sense of what numpy arrays are good for and how they work, though you'll probably need to put in some time working with them to really get a good feel for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From naive loops to n-dimensional arrays\n",
    "In many disciplines, data analysis consists largely of the analysis of *tabular* data—meaning, two-dimensional tables where data are structured into rows and columns, with each observation typically taking up a row, and each column representing a single variable. Neuroimaging data analysis also often involves tabular data, and we'll spend a lot of time later on discussing some of the tools Python provides for working efficiently with tabular data. However, one of the notable features of neuroimaging is that datasets are often large, and naturally tend to have many dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a typical \"resting state\" fMRI study, in which participants simply lie in the scanner at rest while the machine around them does its thing. Suppose we have 20 participants, each scanned for roughly 30 minutes, with a repetition time (TR)—i.e., the duration of acquisition of each fMRI volume—of 1 second. If the data are acquired at an isotropic spatial resolution of 2mm (i.e., each brain \"voxel\", or 3-dimensional pixel is 2 mm along each dimension), then the resulting dataset might have approximately 20 x 1800 x 100 x 100 x 100 = 36 billion observations. That's a lot of data! Moreover, each subject's data has a clear 4 dimensional structure—the 3 spatial dimensions, plus time. If we wanted to, we could also potentially represent subjects as the 5th dimension, though that involves some complications, since at least initially, different subjects' brains won't be aligned with one another—we'd need to spatially register them for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be helpful to visualize a single subject's data to get a better sense of what the data look like. Of course, most of us mere mortals don't naturally think in 4 dimensions, so we'll need to cheat a little bit. We'll take advantage of the fact that the 3 spatial dimensions have an obvious structure to them, and then we'll concatenate consecutive 3d volumes along a time axis to get the 4th dimension. Here's the idea (image from the [nilearn docs](https://nilearn.github.io/building_blocks/manual_pipeline.html)):\n",

    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "We will typically want to access this data in pretty specific ways. That is, rather than applying an operation to every single voxel in the brain, at every single point in time, we usually want to pull out specific *slices* of the data, and only apply an operation to those slices. Say for example we're interested in a voxel in the amygdala. How would we access only that voxel, at every time point?\n",
    "\n",
    "A very naive approach that we could implement in pure Python would be to store all our data as a nested series of Python lists: each element in the first list would be a list containing data for one time point; each element within the list for each time point would itself be a list containing the 2d slices at each x-coordinate; and so on. Then we could write a series of 4 nested for-loops to sequentially access every data point (or voxel) in our array. For each voxel we inspect, we could then determine whether the voxel is one we want to work with, and if so, apply some operation to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we'd have something like this (note that this is just pseudocode, not valid Python code, and you can't execute this snippet!):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for t in time:\n",
    "    for x in t:\n",
    "        for y in x:\n",
    "            for z in y:\n",
    "                if z is in amygdala:\n",
    "                    apply_my_function(z)\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Something like the above would probably work just fine. But it would be very inefficient, and might take a while to execute. Notice that even if we only want to access a single amygdala voxel at each timepoint (i.e., 1800 data points in total, if we stick with our resting state example from above), our naive looping approach still requires us to inspect every single one of the 1.8 billion voxels in our dataset—even if all we're doing for the vast majority of voxels is deciding that we don't actually need to use that voxel in our analysis! This is, to put it mildly, A Bad Thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer scientists have developed a notation for more precisely describing how much of a bad thing it is: *Big O notation*, which gives us a formal way of representing the time complexity of an algorithm. In Big O notation, the code above runs in $O(n^4)$ time. Meaning, for any given dimension size $n$ (we assume for simplicity that $n$ is the same for all dimensions), we need to perform on the order of $n^4$ computations. To put this in perspective, just going from $n = 2$ to $n = 4$ means that we go from $2^4 = 16$ to $4^4 = 256$ operations. You can see how this might start to become problematic as $n$ gets large.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson we should take away from this is that writing naive Python loops just to access the values at a specific index in our dataset is a bad idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List indexing\n",
    "Fortunately, since we've already covered list indexing in Python, we have a better way to access the amygdala data we want. We know that the outer dimension in our nested list represents time, and we also know that the spatial index of the amygdala voxel we want will be constant across time points. This means that instead of writing a 4-level nested for-loop, we can do the job in just a single loop. If we know that the index of the amygdala voxel we want in our 3-d image is [20, 18, 32], then the following code suffices (again note that this code can't be executed):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "amygdala_values = []\n",
    "\n",
    "for t in dataset:\n",
    "    amygdala_values.append(t[20][18][32])\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "That's a big improvement! In terms of time complexity! We've gone from an $O(n^4)$ to an $O(n)$ algorithm. The time our new algorithm takes to run is now linear in the number of timepoints in our dataset, rather than growing as a polynomial function of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Towards a specialized array structure\n",
    "Unfortunately, our new approach still isn't great. One problem is that performance still won't be so good, because base Python isn't really optimized for the kind of operation we just saw—i.e., indexing repeatedly into nested lists. For one thing, Python is a dynamically typed language, so there will be some overhead involved in accessing each individual element (because the interpreter has to examine the object and determine its type), and this can quickly add up if we have millions or billions of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other big limitation is that, even if lists themselves were super fast to work with, the Python standard library provides limited functionality for doing numerical analysis on them. There are a lot of basic numerical operations we might want to apply to our data that would be really annoying to write in core Python. For example, Python lists don't natively support matrix operations, so if we wanted to multiply one matrix (represented as a list of lists) by another, we'd probably need to write out a series of summations and multiplications ourselves inside for-loops. And that would be completely impractical given how basic and common an operation matrix multiplication is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom line is that, as soon as we start working with large, or highly structured datasets—as is true of most datasets in neuroimaging—we're going to have to look beyond what Python provides us in its standard library. Lists just aren't going to cut it; we need some other kind of data structure—one that's optimized for numerical analysis on large, N-dimensional datasets. This is where *numpy* comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numpy\n",
    "Numpy is the backbone of the numerical and scientific computing stack in Python; many of the libraries we'll cover in this course (SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.) depend on it internally. Numpy provides many data structures optimized for efficient representation and manipulation of different kinds of high-dimensional data, as well as an enormous range of numerical tools that help us work with those structures. Because numpy is so fundamental to scientific computing in Python, we'll spend most of our time in this notebook learning how to use it. Then we'll devote a little bit of time at the end to two other important packages that build on numpy (scipy and pandas).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing numpy\n",
    "Recall that, in Python, the default namespace contains only a small number of built-in functions. To use any other functionality, we need to explicitly import it into our namespace. Let's do that for numpy:"

But the visual representation closely resembles what we'd see if we were to print a nested list in Python. In the 2-dimensional case above, the elements of the outer list are the values along the first dimension, and each inner list gives the values along the second dimension. This ends up giving us a nice tabular representation, where, at least for small arrays, we can just read off the values from the output. For example, the first row of the array contains the values [1, 2, 5]; the second column of the array contains the values [2, 1]; and so on.\n",

Because it'll be covered in much more detail later, I won't explain what we're doing here, except to say that in the following two lines, we're loading an anatomical brain image (in Nifti format) into Python, and then extracting the actual 3-dimensional data (conveniently already stored in a numpy array) into its own variable."

    "Just like that, in a single line of code, we've turned a 2-dimensional array of numbers into a plot of an axial brain slice!\n",
    "\n",
    "Granted, it probably isn't the most beautiful brain image anyone's ever seen; gray matter, as its name implies, is usually gray (or at worst, pinkish), and not neon green. But no matter. In later parts of the course, we'll mess around with Python's vast visualization capabilities, and you'll be able to tweak the colors, and everything else about the above figure, to your heart's content. For now, the important thing is just to gaze in awe upon the image above.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to take what we just did for granted, seeing as it only took us 3 - 4 line of code. As we get deeper into the course, and do far more sophisticated things with neuroimaging data, the above example will probably start to seem really trivial (if it doesn't already). Still, it's worth taking a moment to think about what we were able to accomplish in a matter of seconds, thanks to the heroic efforts of tens of thousands of scientists, engineers, and software developers that came before us. We took a 2-dimensional array containing about 10,000 floating-point numbers, and just by mapping those values onto different colors, we were able to project the array onto a visual plot in a way that allows us to immediately *see* and make sense of an actual human brain--a brain that was imaged using an extremely large magnet, while still safely housed inside somebody's skull (technically, the image is derived from many people's brains, but you get the point). That's pretty remarkable, isn't it?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From image to world coordinates\n",
    "If you've worked with human brain images before, you might recognize the slice plotted above: in the standard coordinate space used in MRI, it's the slice you get at $z = 0$—i.e., an axial (or transverse, or horizontal) slice through roughly the middle of the brain. In this space, the origin (i.e., the point with coordinates (0, 0, 0)) is conventionally located at the midpoint of the line between the anterior and posterior commissures (the AC-PC line).\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with this knowledge, you might be thinking that it should be easy to plot a brain slice along *any* of the conventional axes—axial (as above), sagittal, or coronal. And you'd be right. Now that we know that the image-space dimensions we've labeled $i$, $j$, and $k$ correspond to the world-space axes $x$, $y$, and $z$, it's a snap to plot any slice we want. For example, to plot the coronal slice at $y = 10$:"

But remember: image space and world space are different things. Later in the course, when we cover NiBabel, we'll talk at length about the *affine* array contained in every Nifti image file's header, which tells us exactly what the mapping between the two spaces is. For now, we can dispense with any confusion by observing that each voxel in our image is 2 mm in width, so moving 10 mm in world space (from $y = 0$ to $y = 10$) corresponds to a move of only 5 element in image space."

    "Sometimes the existing structure or shape of an array doesn't lend itself well to the operations we intend to perform. This is common, for example, when doing linear algebra, which often needs arrays to have dimensions that align with one another in certain ways. Fortunately, numpy gives us lots of tools for restructuring arrays in various ways. Let's explore a few of them.\n",

    "As you might intuitively expect, the new shape has to be compatible with the old one. It would be strange if we could, say, reshape an array with shape `(100,)` into one with shape `(179, 1)`; where would the extra 79 elements in the latter magically come from? (You can verify this for yourself by replacing `(10, 10)` with `(179, 1)` above, and watching numpy yell at you.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to ensure compatible shapes is to provide a new shape tuple that implies an equal number of elements to the existing array. Meaning, the product of the old shape tuple should be equal to the product of the new one. In the above example, we created a 1-dimensional array with 100 values, and then reshaped it to a 2-dimensional array with shape `(10, 10)`. This works, because `(100,)` and `(10, 10)` both imply the same number of elements (100). We could also have reshaped to `(50, 2)`, `(4, 25)`, and so on.\n",
